# 👋 Hi there, I'm Hossein Khonsari!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in deep learning, big data, and scalable AI systems. With a passion for solving real-world problems, I specialize in building and deploying end-to-end machine learning solutions.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design, develop, and deploy ML models for production
- Build robust data pipelines using Python, Spark, and AWS
- Research and experiment with foundation models, NLP, computer vision, and LLMs
- Communicate complex insights through visualization and storytelling

## 🧠 Technical Stack

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Spark, SQL
- **Domains:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, Anomaly Detection
- **Platforms:** AWS (Sagemaker, Glue, Batch), GitHub, Docker, Tableau, RedShift

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🩺 [Dermatology Disease Classification](https://github.com/hossein2024-hub/Dermatology)
As part of the  University of Toronto DSI Certificate capstone team project, I co-developed this ML pipeline to classify skin conditions using different ML algorithms.  
✅ My contributions (in collaboration with my teammates):
- Designed and trained tree models (XG Boost, Extra Trees, Random Forest), KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and augmentation
- Built reusable training pipelines and evaluation scripts
- Delivered interpretable insights and presentation materials

### 🤖 [Generative AI with LLMs](https://github.com/hossein2024-hub/Generative-AI-with-LLMs)
A hands-on exploration of text generation using transformer-based architectures.  
✅ Covers tokenizer engineering, fine-tuning, and GPT model behavior.

### 🔬 [Deep Learning Notebooks](https://github.com/hossein2024-hub/deep_learning)
A repository of deep learning examples including CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based models built from scratch and with PyTorch/Keras.
